1. Creating a basic script importing time module

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time

2. Checking the localtime in struct_time format

print(x)
print(f"Fetching the day of month: {x.tm_mday}, The year is: {x[0]}")

3. Validating the same time in GMT as well

y = time.gmtime()
print(y)

4. Checking current time in Human readable format

print(time.ctime())

5. Now making time in seconds since epoch

print(f"The time in sec provided by mktime till now is given as: {time.mktime(x)} ")

6. Checking the process time and holding the script for 10 sec

time.sleep(10)
print(time.process_time())

7. Using time in any exisiting script

start_time = time.localtime()
...
stop_time = time.localtime()
...
difference = time.mktime(stop_time) - time.mktime(start_time)
